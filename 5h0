1) First, we create three tables in MySQL:

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    student_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT,
    year_id INT
);

CREATE TABLE department (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE year (
    year_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    year_name VARCHAR(20)
);
```

2) establish relationships between the tables

ALTER TABLE students
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_department
FOREIGN KEY (department_id)
REFERENCES department(department_id);

ALTER TABLE students
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_year
FOREIGN KEY (year_id)
REFERENCES year(year_id);
```

3)
// Collection for students
{
    "_id": ObjectId("..."),
    "student_name": "John Doe",
    "department": {
        "department_name": "CSE"
    },
    "year": {
        "year_name": "Sophomore"
    }
}
```
4)
INSERT INTO students (student_name, department_id, year_id) VALUES
('Alice', 1, 1),
('Bob', 1, 2),
('Charlie', 1, 3),
('David', 1, 1),
('Eve', 1, 2),
('Frank', 2, 1),
('Grace', 2, 2),
('Harry', 2, 3),
('Ivy', 2, 1),
('Jack', 2, 2);
```

5) To display students from the CSE department in MySQL:

SELECT * FROM students WHERE department_id = 1;

6) To display only department names using the student table:

SELECT department.department_name
FROM students
JOIN department ON students.department_id = department.department_id;

7) To display students sorted by department and then by first name:

SELECT students.student_name, department.department_name
FROM students
JOIN department ON students.department_id = department.department_id
ORDER BY department.department_name, students.student_name;
